## Swift-Benchmarks

Varied benchmarks of Swift code.

This is essentially just a place to publish benchmark code.  The benchmarks are not necessarily self-explanatory; many were created & published here for the purposes of documentation or illustration of a blog post.

### Executing the benchmarks

`swift package benchmark`

See [the documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/ordo-one/package-benchmark/1.11.2/documentation/benchmark/runningbenchmarks) for the [Benchmark](https://github.com/ordo-one/package-benchmark) package for details.
